# Germany's (slow) transformation to renewable electricity¶
_A data visualisation project by [Jan Kühn](https://yotka.org), January 2023_

## What is this about?

For many years, German governments have pledged to leave fossil sources behind to generate electricity. The data shows that there have been some successes. But as the climate crisis worsens, electricity generation from fossil sources is on the rise again. This notebook explores data from 2015 to 2022 provided by [SMARD](https://www.smard.de/home/downloadcenter/download-marktdaten/), a service of the Federal Network Agency ([Bundesnetzagentur](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/)).
